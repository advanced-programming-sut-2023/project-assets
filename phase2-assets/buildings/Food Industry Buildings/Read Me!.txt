Now, I may seem lazy by not putting the sprites in sheets like how most sprites on this site are. However,
you have to take into account that it's easier this way. Because you can edit them, then easily import them back 
into the game. It's also easier for other contributers, because they will be able to see which files I omitted or 
forgotten to include.

Now on to the technical aspects of this contribution:

This readme file is present in each zipped folder that I submitted. Thus, not everything written may apply to this
folder.

The tools I used couldn't correctly extract the following GM1 Animations:

Spearman
Catapult
Trebuchet
Shield
Knight top
Knight bottom
Crusader lord
Arabian lord
Some flags
Crossbowman
...And probably some others that I forgot.

The problem with the images from this list is how the colours are extracted, they get all messed up. So much that 
in some cases you can hardly identify what it is.

I've deliberately omitted the following TGX images:

Random green, red and grey squares, they don't have real purposes.
Black. - An empty black image.
Easter eggs? - Crude drawings of symbols supposed to represent Wolf, Rat, Pig and Snake. The name of files are named after who they represent.
Some probably beta stuff - seemingly early dev. stuff, they're quite ugly and few, thus I didn't feel the need to include them.
Leftovers from the previous title 
Tutorial images

By the way, some sprites may look invisible, pay more attention because they're actually white!
